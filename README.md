## Tutorial
In this installation, I would assume you have a freshly installed Kali or Ubuntu. So, I would go through every necessary package that needs to be installed. If your operating system has some packages installed, itâ€™s no harm to install them again just to make sure everything is working properly.
Note that all the following commands are run as a superuser. To run commands as superuser, write the following command in the terminal, ``` sudo su ``` ten write your password.
